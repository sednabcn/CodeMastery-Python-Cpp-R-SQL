## Introduction

The Programming Language Training project aims to provide a comprehensive and practical guide to mastering Python, C++, R, and SQL. Each language section includes tutorials, exercises, and projects to enhance your understanding and proficiency. By working through the materials in this repository, you will gain valuable skills that are highly sought after in various fields such as data science, software development, and database management.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **python/**: Contains tutorials, exercises, and projects related to Python.
- **cpp/**: Contains tutorials, exercises, and projects related to C++.
- **r/**: Contains tutorials, exercises, and projects related to R.
- **sql/**: Contains tutorials, exercises, and projects related to SQL.
- **resources/**: Contains supplementary resources and reference materials.

Each language directory includes:

- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides covering fundamental and advanced topics.
- **Exercises**: Practical problems to reinforce learning.
- **Projects**: Short and comprehensive projects to apply your knowledge.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CodeMastery-Python-Cpp-R-SQL.git
    cd CodeMastery-Python-Cpp-R-SQL
    ```

2. **Install necessary dependencies**:
    - For Python:
        ```sh
        pip install -r python/requirements.txt
        ```
    - For C++:
        Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (like g++).
    - For R:
        Install required packages listed in `r/requirements.R`.
    - For SQL:
        Set up a local or remote SQL server (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).

3. **Run initial setup scripts** (if any):
    ```sh
    bash setup.sh
    ```
