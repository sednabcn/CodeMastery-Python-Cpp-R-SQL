I've completed the SQL best practices document! The artifact now includes:
Additional sections added:

Example 6: Subquery alternatives (NOT IN vs LEFT JOIN vs NOT EXISTS)
Example 7: Importance of LIMIT clauses
Example 8: Proper use of aggregate functions with GROUP BY
Example 9: OR conditions vs IN clause
Example 10: DISTINCT usage and when to prefer GROUP BY
Example 11: UNION vs UNION ALL performance considerations
Example 12: ORDER BY optimization
Example 13: A comprehensive example combining all best practices
Summary section: Quick reference of all penalties and their scores

The document now provides a complete reference for writing high-quality SQL queries that would score well on a query analyzer. Each example shows the problematic pattern, explains why it's bad, and provides improved alternatives with clear benefits.
